this is my journey to learn and understand React

## Question & Answer

**Q1- what is building blocks of a web applications ?** <br />
**A1-** there are few things you need to consider while building a modern applications. such as:
- **User Interface:** how user will consume and interact with the application.
- **Routing:** how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- **Data Fetching:** where your data lives and how to get it.
- **Rendering:** when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- **Integrations:** what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
- **Infrastructure:** where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
- **Performance:** how to optimize your application for end-users.
- **Scalability:** how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- **Developer Experience:** your team's experience building and maintaining your application. <br />

**Q2- What is React ?** <br />
**A2- React** is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It's particularly well-suited for creating *8single-page applications (SPAs)** and **dynamic UIs**.

**Q001- What is Next.js ?** <br />
**A001 - Next.js** is a **React framework** that provides additional features and tools to simplify the development of web applications. It includes features like **server-side rendering**, **automatic code splitting**, and **file-system routing**, making it easier to build fast and scalable web applications.


**Q002- How does Next.js help with building web applications ?** <br />
**A002- Next.js** offers several features that streamline the development process, including:
- **Server-side rendering (SSR):** Renders pages on the server, improving initial load times and SEO.
- **Automatic code splitting:** Optimizes page loading by only loading the necessary JavaScript4code for each page.
- **File-system routing:** Creates routes based on the file and folder structure of your project, simplifying routing configuration.
- **API routes:** Allows you to create serverless functions within your Next.js application, making it easier to handle data fetching and other server-side tasks.

**Q003- What are the benefits of using React and Next.js ?** <br />
**A003-** Some of the benefits of using React and Next.js include:
- **Improved performance:** Features like SSR and code splitting can significantly improve page load times.
- **Enhanced user experience:** React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it easier to build dynamic and interactive UIs.
- **Increased developer productivity:** Next.js provides a range of features and tools that can speed up development and make it more efficient.
- **Better SEO:** SSR can help improve your application's search engine ranking.
- **Strong community and ecosystem:** React and Next.js have large and active communities, providing access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and libraries.

**Q3- What is DOM ?** <br />
**A3-** The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is an object representation of the HTML elements on a web page.

**Q004- How does the browser render a web page ?** <br />
**A004-** When a user visits a web page, the server returns an HTML file to the **browser**. The **browser** then reads the HTML and constructs the **DOM**. The **DOM** is an object representation of the HTML elements.
